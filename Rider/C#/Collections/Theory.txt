Collection = Dynamic Array

What was the problem with the array ?
int[] arr = new int[10];

-> Length is fixed
-> Inserting values in the middle 
-> Deleting or Removing values in the middle

Non-Generic Collections:    Stack, Queue, LinkedList, SortedList, ArrayList, Hashtable
    
    ArrayList, Hashtable
-> They're not type safe
-> we can enter any type of values

-> SOOOO... We want
Array - Can't change Fixed size
Hashtable - No type safety
We want solution for both

--> Generic Collections
System.Collections.Generic;

List, Dictionary, Set   <- Generics
ArrayList, Hashtable, Stack, Queue  <- Non generics


-> SortedList is somewhat better than SortedDictionary
